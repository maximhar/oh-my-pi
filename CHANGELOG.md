## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.378] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed

- `git-status` hook now fires only once at session start instead of every turn

## [1.3.377] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- `rg` tool: ripgrep-based text search for fast regex pattern matching across codebases
- `glob` tool: fd-based file pattern matching with modification time sorting
- `replace_all` tool: sd-based find and replace for literal and regex string replacement across files
- `ast` tool: ast-grep structural search and replace for AST-level code transformations
- `notebook_edit` tool: cell-level editing of Jupyter notebook files
- `git-status` hook: injects repository state at conversation start
- Subagent session persistence: when `persistSessions` is enabled, subagent sessions and outputs are stored alongside the parent session in `<session-dir>/<session-name>/<agent>_<id>.{jsonl,out.md,in.md}`
- Recursive subagent option: agents can now set `recursive: true` in frontmatter to allow nested Task tool invocations

### Fixed

- Runtime config loader now uses deep merge to preserve nested defaults when merging store overrides
- Documentation now correctly states that hooks must use `omp.hooks` field, not `install` (which is only for static files like agents, commands, themes)

## [1.3.376] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- Model fallback aliases (`haiku, flash`) for subagents to improve compatibility across providers
- Windows shell support (`cmd`, `powershell`) in `omp env` command

### Changed

- Build target switched from Bun to Node for broader runtime compatibility

### Fixed

- Cross-platform command detection and Windows path handling in web renderer
- Windows compatibility: npm commands now use `npm.cmd` on Windows
- Windows compatibility: atomic file rename in lockfile now handles EEXIST
- Windows compatibility: `~` path expansion uses `os.homedir()` instead of `$HOME`
- Windows compatibility: LSP plugin uses `where` instead of `which` for command detection
- Windows compatibility: LSP file URIs use correct `file:///C:/` format on Windows
- Windows compatibility: path construction uses proper `path.join()` segments throughout
- Windows compatibility: subagent tasks now passed via temp file instead of CLI args to avoid shell escaping issues
- Windows compatibility: subagent spawns `pi.cmd` with proper shell option on Windows
- Windows compatibility: LSP server spawn uses shell option on Windows
- Windows compatibility: render-web external commands (markitdown, lynx) use shell for proper PATHEXT resolution
